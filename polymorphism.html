<h1>Polymorphism</h1>
</p>Polymorphism meaning many forms.It enables objects of different classes
to be treated as instances of a common superclass,allowing a single 
intrfaces to represent different underlying forms (datatype)<p>

</h2>Example</h2>
</p>Shape base on class has a draw() method,but subclasses Circle,Square,
and Triangle each implement draw() differently.When calling draw() on list
of shapes, each object acts according to its specific type.

</h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhances code flexibility,
 <li>Reusability
</li>Maintainability    
</ul>

<p>Polymorphismallows methods to behave differntly</p>
